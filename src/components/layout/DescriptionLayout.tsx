    <p>
        It is a calculator to calculate attributes to characters for
        a Brazilian &quot;TTRPG&quot; (Table Top Role Playing Game) 
        called Tormenta20, very famous on Brazil.
        Its system is an adaptation from D20 SRD with his 
        own scenario, a medieval fantasy with some inspirations
        on anime and with some Lovecraftian-like creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this universe called Arton there is an phenomena called 
        Tormenta, an corrupted storm from another dimension that brings 
        with it corrupted demon creatures called Lefeu, this storm
        also affect humanoids corrupting them and transforming its 
        bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also there is an importance for the number 20 on this RPG, that
        came from the 20 years since the first release of the scenario,
        the 20 major gods that control this world and the 20-sided 
        die (a classic and important dice for the game), all this led 
        its writers to name the most recent version as <b>Tormenta 20</b>.

    <h1 className="text-4xl mt-8 font-bold">How it works?</h1>
    <p>
        On Tormenta20 &quot;Edição Jogo do Ano&quot; the character&apos;s
        attributes are the same from D&D3.5: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
        Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma, but theres no modifier mechanic, 
        because on T20 the attribute value works as the classical 
        attribute modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        All races modify the attribute in some way, some give a bonus to some attributes,
        others can subtract values from certain attributes and others can give you
        the choice to choose what attributes do you wanna buff.
    </p>
    <p>
        The book mentions 2 ways to get your attributes, one of them is
        rolling a 4d6 taking the 3 highest and looking into a table to
        define the attribute, the other one is a <b>points system</b>,
        which this calculator is made for.
