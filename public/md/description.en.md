# What is this application?

It is a calculator to help you building attributes to characters from
a Brazilian &quot;TTRPG&quot; (Table Top Role Playing Game)
called Tormenta20, very famous on Brazil.

# How it works?

On Tormenta20 &quot;Edição Jogo do Ano&quot; the character&apos;s
attributes are the same from D&D3.5: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma, but theres no modifier mechanic, 
because on T20 the attribute value works as the classical 
attribute modifier.

All races modify the attribute in some way, some give a bonus to some attributes,
others can subtract values from certain attributes and others can give you
the choice to choose what attributes do you wanna buff.

The book mentions 2 ways to get your attributes, one of them is
rolling a 4d6 taking the 3 highest and looking into the table to
define the attribute, the other one is a **points system**,
which this calculator is made for. In this system you have 10
points to define how to distribute your attributes, each value
has a cost in points.

| Attribute | Cost | Roll |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -2 | - | 7 or less |
| -1 | -1 point | 8-9 |
| 0 | 0 point | 10-11 |
| 1 | 1 point | 12-13 |
| 2 | 2 points | 14-15 |
| 3 | 4 points | 16-17 |
| 4 | 7 points | 18 |

# Who created this?
Hi, my name is Patrick Dorneles and I am a RPG player, software developer and aspiring
game developer. I do love RPG and been playing on Arton since 2016 where I discovered the Tormenta RPG
book, and it was always awesome, now with this new version I liked a lot this new attribute
system but since there was many calculators for the legacy D&D inspired modifier system but
no calculators for this one I feeled that I could do it. If you can I will love any help or
feedback about this project, that you can find on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/PatrickDorneles/T20AttributeCalculator).
