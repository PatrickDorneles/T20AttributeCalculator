# What is this application?

It is a calculator to help you building attributes to characters from
a Brazilian &quot;TTRPG&quot; (Table Top Role Playing Game)
called Tormenta20, very famous on Brazil.
Its system is an adaptation from D20 SRD with his 
own scenario, a medieval fantasy with some inspirations
on anime.

In this universe called Arton there is a phenomenon called 
Tormenta (that gives the system its name): it is 
a corrupted storm from another dimension that brings 
with it corrupted demon creatures called Lefeu, this storm
also affect humanoids corrupting them and the places where it happens.

There is an importance for the number 20 on this RPG, that
came from the 20 years since the first release of the scenario,
the 20 major gods that control this world and the 20-sided 
die (a classic and important dice for the game), all this led 
its writers to name the most recent version as **Tormenta 20**.

# How it works?

On Tormenta20 &quot;Edição Jogo do Ano&quot; the character&apos;s
attributes are the same from D&D3.5: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma, but theres no modifier mechanic, 
because on T20 the attribute value works as the classical 
attribute modifier.

All races modify the attribute in some way, some give a bonus to some attributes,
others can subtract values from certain attributes and others can give you
the choice to choose what attributes do you wanna buff.

The book mentions 2 ways to get your attributes, one of them is
rolling a 4d6 taking the 3 highest and looking into the table to
define the attribute, the other one is a **points system**,
which this calculator is made for. In this system you have 10
points to define how to distribute your attributes, each value
has a cost and set of values to roll for the dice system.

| Attribute | Cost | Roll |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -2 | - | 7 or less |
| -1 | -1 point | 8-9 |
| 0 | 0 point | 10-11 |
| 1 | 1 point | 12-13 |
| 2 | 2 points | 14-15 |
| 3 | 4 points | 16-17 |
| 4 | 7 points | 18 |

# Who made this?
Hi, my name is Patrick Dorneles and I am a RPG player, software developer and aspiring
game developer, I love RPG and play on Arton since 2016 where I discovered the Tormenta RPG
book, and it was always awesome, now with this new version I liked a lot this new attribute
system but since there was many calculators for the legacy D&D inspired modifier system but
no calculators for this one I feeled that I could do it. If you can I will love any help or
feedback about this project, that you can find on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/PatrickDorneles/T20AttributeCalculator).
